# restaurant-site

A dummy restaurant site for "City Wok" from South Park

## Objectives

- Practice using npm
- Setup, configure & use webpack
- Practice using JS modules

## Credits

- [Credits to South Park (City Wok, City Wok logo, characters)](https://www.southparkstudios.com/)
- The images used for menu items have links to credit the creators on the bottom left of the image

## Conclusion

The site, built by webpack, uses modules to change contents of the page with just a click. In creating this,
all the objectives of this practice project were completed.

### What I Learned

- Using **npm** to install tools like **webpack** and plugins
- Configuring and using **webpack** to build static sites
- Using JS modules and creating modular scripts
- Manipulating the DOM and creating a lot of DOM objects

### Future updates

- Responsive - The site needs to be made responsive since it breaks at smaller resolutions
- Better DOM object creation - Current implementation of DOM element creation is redundant and needs to be changed
